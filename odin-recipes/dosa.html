        <li>Take all the ingredients to prepare the dosa batter.</li>
        <li>Rinse both types of rice (regular rice and parboiled rice) together in water</li>
        <li>Rinse urad dal and chana dal together in water</li>
        <li>Drain water from urad dal in a small bowl and reserve it </li>
        <li>Add water as needed and grind until smooth and fluffy batter</li>
        <li>The batter should be fluffy and not very thick. Transfer it to a large container.</li>
        <li>Drain water from rice and add them to the same mixer grinder jar.</li>
        <li>Add water as needed and grind until smooth texture.</li>
        <li>Add salt and mix both batters well using spoon.</li>
        <li>During fermentation, the batter volume would increase and the tiny bubbles would appear on the surface when you stir it with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Heat non-stick tava or iron tava (skillet or griddle) over medium flame</li>
        <li>Apply 1-teaspoon oil (or ghee / butter for crispy dosa) around the edges of dosa (or spread oil/ghee/butter evenly with brush for crispy dosa).</li>
        <li>Cook until the bottom surface turns light brown and the edges start to come upward, it will take around 2-minutes</li>
        <li>Flip it and cook for a minute. If you are making thin dosa</li>
